Description: Provides very fast access to whole genome, population scale variation data
	from VCF files and sequence data from FASTA-formatted files.
	It also reads in alignments from FASTA, Phylip, MAF and other file formats.
	Provides easy-to-use interfaces to genome annotation from UCSC and Bioconductor and gene ontology data
	from AmiGO and is capable to read, modify and write PLINK .PED-format pedigree files.
